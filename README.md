# CC: Tweaked Minecraft Mod Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Lua scripts for use with the CC:Tweaked mod in Minecraft. These scripts are designed to automate various tasks when used with in-game turtles or computers.

## Quick Start

To get started with these scripts, you'll first need to manually download the update script onto your in-game turtle or computer. Here are the steps:

1. Open the turtle or computer's interface.
2. Type `edit update` and press Enter. This opens a new file named update.
3. Paste the contents of the [update script]() into the file.
4. Press Ctrl + S to save the file, then Ctrl + E to exit the editor.
5. Run the update script by typing `update` and pressing Enter.

The update script will fetch the latest versions of all scripts from /Programs/ in this repository, and save them to your turtle or computer's local filesystem.
